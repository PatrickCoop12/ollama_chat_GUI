## Ollama Desktop GUI using Python
### This project creates a desktop GUI application for Ollama chat interactions analogous to MS co-pilot. The cheif focus was on developing the UI, so the chatbot is simplified, but in further build-outs conversation memory can be incorporated, the LLM can be provided with Tools to make an Agent, or a RAG workflow can be implemented.
